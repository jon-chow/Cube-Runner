## CUBE RUNNER
A simple 3D game where the player controls a cube and tries to avoid obstacles on a beam.

I had originally followed [a YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDXKp-OKxGs) by Charger Games on mobile game development for Android in Unity3D. However, after completing the tutorial, I realized that the end product was lacking in a lot of aspects, and the way the game worked in scoring was incredibly lazy. Shortly after making some adjustments and experimenting, I decided to add some features to the game and make it my own rendition.

You can download a copy of the APK [here](./Builds/CubeRunner1.apk).
